# Quantum Backflow - Jump Defect
Fortran code for quantum backflow in the presence of a jump defect in the Schrodinger equation.
Calculate the lowest eigenvalue of the probability flux operator (as a Kernel)
on the real line with a defect placed at the origin. Additionally, it adjusts the Kernel with
a term ensuring conservation of momentum and calculates the lowest eigenvalue of the adjusted Kernel.
Plots are produced with all the results for each choice of parameters.
